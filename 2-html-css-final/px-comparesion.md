px (Pixels):

    - Represents a fixed unit of measurement.
    - Does not change based on screen size or resolution.
    - Ideal for precise control but not flexible for responsive design.
    
vw (Viewport Width):

    - Represents a percentage of the viewport's width.
    - 1vw equals 1% of the viewport width.
     - Useful for responsive design, allowing elements to scale based on the browser window size.

rem (Root Element):

    Relative to the font size of the root element (<html>).
    Provides consistency across the site, as changes to the root font size affect all elements using rem.
    Good for scalable and accessible design, allowing easy adjustments to typography and layout.
